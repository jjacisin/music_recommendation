# Music Recommendation Engine
  - Story:
    - Let's assume that I have a repository of music data, and I need to figure out which songs:
      1. Bring users onto the platform
      2. Keep users listening to music on our platform
    - Need to identify:
      1. What are our most popular music pieces by different categories by played?
        - Traditional: Song, Artist, Genre
        - Meta Data: Song Length, Year Released, Years Artist Active (other)
      2. What songs lead to users listening to the next song?
        - Conjecture: I think I may be able to modify the use of a regular music recommendation engine (MRE) to identify which songs are most likely to
        - An MRE looks to predict the next song a user will want to listen to; what songs tend to be the next song a user will listen to?

  - Goals:
    - Visualize which songs users are listening to, broken down by category
    - Determine initial presumption based off of EDA
    - Build MRE and use the model to determine identity of most connected songs
    - Visualize most connected songs* using web
      * Not sure if songs will be the correct category to web; will be determined by strongest category connectino

  - Process Goals:
    - Refresh knowledge of classic recommendation engine
      - Build Jupyter notebook explaining my findings
